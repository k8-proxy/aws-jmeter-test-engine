### JMeter script that handles malware zip files
**Objective**:  As per design malware files are places inside double zip where inner zip is password protected, this is implementation of unzipping logic

- Implementation is using zip4j library (attached) that needs to be imported into JMeter lib folder
- Using zip4j library first zip file is extracted into output folder
- Second zip file has the same name and is extracted into output/final folder using the password
- Malware file name is extracted since the unzipped file has different name
- After the upload to ICAP Server malware file is being deleted from output/final folder
